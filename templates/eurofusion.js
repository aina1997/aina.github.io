         <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><b>EUROfusion</b> is a consortium of national fusion research institutes located in the European Union, Switzerland and Ukraine.
           In 2018, a series of experiments were made on the nuclear fusion reactor Weldenstein 7-X. Throughout these experiments, a huge amount of information was generated and gathered.
             Since January 2019 I have been working in the <b>Group of Image and Video Processing</b> at the UPC in collaboration with the <b>Institut of Plasma Physics</b> to develop code for image and video processing.
             My principal task is to detect anomalies using these experiments data. The next project will be detecting the anomalies using the Generative adversarial network.
             <i>Projects:</i>
             <ul>
               <li>Image and video processing with C++</li>
               <li>Image processing with Python</li>
               <li>Detection of anomalies using GANs (In progress)</li>

            </ul>
